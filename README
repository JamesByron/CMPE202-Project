This repo contains the code and results files for the term project for CMPE 202.

The machine learning code used in the client application was built with help from tutorials on the PyTorch Website:
	PyTorch Website:  http://pytorch.org/
	PyTorch Classification Tutorial: http://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/char_rnn_classification_tutorial.html

The simulator that I used can be downloaded from repository:
	https://github.com/ChampSim

When building the repository, first place the file
	replacements/cramer.llc_repl
into the directory "replacement" directory from the ChmampSim github repository.

Next, download one or more trace files from the dropbox folder:
	https://www.dropbox.com/sh/hh09tt8myuz0jbp/AACAS5zMWHL7coVuS-RbpUksa?dl=0
Place the trace files in a new folder "trace" in the root diroctory of the ChampSim ropository.


Build the simulator with the command
	./build_champsim.sh bimodal no no cramer 1

Run the simulations using the command:
	./run_project.sh
At the same time, open a separate terminal window and run the client python script using the command:
	python3 client.py
Press "t" to get the data to train the simulator.
The simulator will repeat 5 times, and you can press "t" to collect more data to continue training or "l" to start learning based on the data already obtained.

After training and learning completes, run the simulator script (run_project.sh) and press "e" to test the model.
